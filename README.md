This is the start of my web design/front-end and, graphic design, and app journey. I am starting from a complete novice and in 5 years I will be making 6-figures working 20 hours/week as a software engineer bring my and other's ideas to life. 
When this project is done, I will have learned and gained HTML and CSS knowledge so I can build my own personal space on the web. The space will be part journal, calendar, recipe book, vision, project managing board and all about me board.
